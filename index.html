        <p class="date">November 21, 2022</p>
        <p class="intro-text">My path to being a coding student was anything but linear. Thus began a confusing and challenging
            year, but now I'm making progress and am able to produce projects that I'm proud of.

                    <p class="blog-text">First day of starting to learn Ruby on Rails and I have no idea what I've gotten myself into.
                        What are booleans and why does this video keep talking about them like they are the most obvious thing in
                        the world that everyone knows about? I have a bad feeling about this...

                    <p class="blog-text">It turns out that Ruby is really not that popular anymore so on to the next course. I found the free 
                        version of App Academy that says I will get a certificate and be a proficient full stack developer by the time I'm 
                        through with the course. The only thing is there is no support, very few videos, and so hard to get 
                        through their lessons.

                    <p class="blog-text">Well, App Academy was almost impossible for me to follow along. I was spending more time (days more like it)
                        watching YouTube videos trying to figure out what should have been simple coding challenges rather than learning.
                        I've started watching Mosh Hamidani's videos on Git so maybe this is the path forward? Hopefully?

                    <p class="blog-text">It's official. I starting to really like coding, especially the front-end aspect of it. It's so
                        satisfying and I'm so glad Mosh has helped me with my studies that furthered my theoretical and practical
                        knowledge of coding. I no longer feel like I'm drowning without a lifeboat.

                    <p class="blog-text">I'm trying to learn JavaScript Node and I won't sugar coat anything, I hate it. Maybe it is Mosh's course
                        or the fact that I am uncomfortable learning all about background development that doesn't really interest
                        me, but I hope not. Oh, and my computer decides to die NOW. Thanks for nothing Apple.

                    <p class="blog-text">I finally found a program that's right for me! My friend just happened
                        to mention a program called Scrimba and I have never been happier to learn coding. With Mosh's explainations of coding 
                        and Scrimba's hands-on-learning approach, I might just be able to have a coding career.
