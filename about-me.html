        <h2>A brief background</h2>
        <p class="blog-text">A career in coding was not on my radar, to say the least. I got my bachelors degree in political science and
            my masters degree in international development, so definitely not the start of a typical coding career. However,
            I soon found out after getting a policy job in Washington, DC that this was not the life I wanted and after two years
            I decided it was time for a change. 
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text p-line-break">I didn't realize just how big of a change I was going to make, but through a trial and error process, 
            and after months of trying different coding courses, I finally found Scrimba's front-end comprehensive course and now I'm
            well on my way towards working as a front-end developer.</p>

                    <p class="blog-text">First day of starting to learn Ruby on Rails and I have no idea what I've gotten myself into.
                        What are booleans and why does this video keep talking about them like they are the most obvious thing in
                        the world that everyone knows about? I have a bad feeling about this...

                    <p class="blog-text">It turns out that Ruby is really not that popular anymore so on to the next course. I found the free 
                        version of App Academy that says I will get a certificate and be a proficient full stack developer by the time I'm 
                        through with the course. The only thing is there is no support, very few videos, and so hard to get 
                        through their lessons.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="blog-title">Blog Three</h2>
                    <p class="blog-text">Well, App Academy was almost impossible for me to follow along. I was spending more time (days more like it)
                        watching YouTube videos trying to figure out what should have been simple coding challenges rather than learning.
                        I've started watching Mosh Hamidani's videos on Git so maybe this is the path forward? Hopefully?
