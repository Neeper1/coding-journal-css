        <h1 class="featured-article-title">My learning journey as a coding student</h1>
        <p class="featured-article-text">My path to being a coding student was anything but linear. Thus began a confusing and challenging
            year, but now I'm making progress and am able to produce projects that I'm proud of.

        <h2>How I stay committed to learning</h2>
        <p class="blog-text">I was always told that to get over writers block, you need to pick a place where you feel comfortable and 
            are not easily distracted. Once you find that place, go everyday and make yourself sit there, regardless of how productive or not
            you were that day. The main goal at first is habit formation not productivity because one stems from the other.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text p-line-break">
        I adopted this same mindset with coding path. Once I formed a habit, it was easier to get in a productive mindset to commit 
        learning how to code.
        </p>
            

        <h2>How I got started</h2>
        <p class="blog-text">At first, I was just using pen and paper to record my progress during my coding journey. Once I 
            started my fifth notebook in 3 months, I realized I needed a more sustainable way to record my progress and my
            notes from my studies--which resulted in this online journal.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text p-line-break">This journal helped me grow what I was learning because it kept me motivated to continue
            posting my summaries which kept me accountable and on-track.

                    <p class="blog-text">First day of starting to learn Ruby on Rails and I have no idea what I've gotten myself into.
                        What are booleans and why does this video keep talking about them like they are the most obvious thing in
                        the world that everyone knows about? I have a bad feeling about this...

                    <h2 class="blog-title">Blog Two</h2>
                    <p class="blog-text">It turns out that Ruby is really not that popular anymore so on to the next course. I found the free 
                        version of App Academy that says I will get a certificate and be a proficient full stack developer by the time I'm 
                        through with the course. The only thing is there is no support, very few videos, and so hard to get 
                        through their lessons.

                    <h2 class="blog-title">Blog Three</h2>
                    <p class="blog-text">Well, App Academy was almost impossible for me to follow along. I was spending more time (days more like it)
                        watching YouTube videos trying to figure out what should have been simple coding challenges rather than learning.
                        I've started watching Mosh Hamidani's videos on Git so maybe this is the path forward? Hopefully?
